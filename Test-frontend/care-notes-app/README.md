## üèóÔ∏è Design Decisions and Assumptions

### Technology Stack
- **Next.js 14**: Chosen for its excellent developer experience, built-in routing, and server-side rendering capabilities
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid UI development and consistent design system
- **shadcn/ui**: For pre-built, accessible components that follow modern design patterns
- **React Hook Form**: For efficient form handling and validation
- **Zod**: For runtime type validation and schema definition

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular components for reusability and maintainability
2. **Custom Hooks**: Separation of business logic from UI components
3. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript usage throughout the application
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS breakpoints
5. **Accessibility**: Built with accessibility in mind using shadcn/ui components

### Key Features Implemented
- **Dashboard**: Overview of care notes with statistics and recent entries
- **Care Notes Management**: Create, view, edit, and delete care notes
- **Search and Filtering**: Advanced search functionality with multiple filters
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Modern UI**: Clean, intuitive interface with smooth animations
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation with helpful error messages

### Assumptions Made
1. **Backend API**: Assumes a RESTful API running on `localhost:8000` with specific endpoints
2. **Data Structure**: Care notes have properties like title, content, patient info, timestamps, etc.
3. **Authentication**: Basic authentication system (can be extended with NextAuth.js)
4. **Real-time Updates**: Not implemented but can be added with WebSockets or Server-Sent Events
5. **File Uploads**: Not included but can be added for attachments

## üîÆ Future Improvements and Additions
